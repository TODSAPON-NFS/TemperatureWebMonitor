TemperatureWebMonitor
=====================

This project concerns the implementation of a security platform for the management and control of an HPCC (High Performance Computing Cluster). Based on open source technologies applied to products such as Arduino Yun and Scientific Linux OS.
The project specifications document is part of an electrical engineer thesis grade. If you want to view the full documentation only for learning more about this, please contact to me by sending an email to address that appears in the next section.


IMPORTANT INFO:

 - I assume that who try to implement this project has basic knowledge about Arduino boards and Linux enviroments. If it is false, please visit the Arduino Yun official web for gettting started (http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoYun).
 
 - I've wrote a complete tutorial for mounting the entire scenario project. It includes IDE installation for Arduino Yun developers, the setup to starting up the web server into the board, and others configurations. The tuturial was wrote in Spanish but in a few days I will upload a translation to English of this. In order to get the tutorial, please write me an email to arturofelixchari@gmail.com.
 
 - For see this project application running please watch on my demostration video in youtube (http://youtu.be/Emm25DyEQ_M)
